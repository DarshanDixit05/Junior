  We need a web interface in addition to the interactive session.

  In the first version we will only have a single input field for the
  user to enter their notes (it is errorneously called task in the interactive session).
  When the start button is clicked, the prompt is generated and displayed to the user.

  First, let's start with installing missing dependencies, configuring the
  backend and solidjs frontend, vite bundling and creating the basic structure of the
  webapp. An index.html is also needed.

  Write a README.md for this _exploratory_ project!
  Project oneliner: Your AI contributor which writes itself.
  The goal of the project is to allow the programmer to communicate only
  with the AI, and only supervise the development process, similarly to
  how Linus Thorwalds supervises the kernel development without writing code (mention this!).

  Describe the followings to the end user!
    - What is the prompt descriptor (current_prompt.yaml, or specified by --prompt=myprompt.yaml),
      and how it is used to generate a prompt. Provide a simple example yaml!
    - How the attention mechanism works (files are printed, dirs listed)
format: prompt/format/new_file_version.md

Provide the new or modified file(s) as code blocks, each prefixed with its path and a colon.
JS files should only export a single function and be named after the function: e.g. `myFn.js` should export `myFn()`.
Always output full files, copying unchanged content.

E.g.:

texts/sample.txt:
```
A sample text file.
```

## Generate a Vue project

Create a good start for the project, including

- Dependencies that are really needed
- A git repo
- Prefer TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node
- The resulting files should NOT contain business logic!
- Install create-vue locally for scaffolding!
- Work in the current directory: if you need to create a subdir, move everything out from it when done!

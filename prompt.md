# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!
- Every js file should only export a single function!
- Use ES6 imports!

Requirements:

I need a vscode extension that reacts to a hotkey.
Scaffold it in src/integrations/vscode



# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, prefer heredoc-ing full files without substitution.
Assume OSX.
npm and jq are installed.
Do NOT write any text outside the script (the plan goes into it)!


EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
# Goal: [Task description, max 7 words]
# Plan:
# 1. [...]

[Commands solving the task]
```

# attention - Render the current attention in Markdown.

Processes a reference file ('attention.txt') that contains relative paths to different files and directories.
It uses the functions defined in 'filesystem.js' to process these paths.
The reference file contains relative paths (from the root) to files and directories, one on each line.
For each listed file, the module prints its name along with the contents. For each listed directory, 
it prints the directory name and a comma-separated list of its contents.
In case the reference file is missing or unreadable, an error is thrown.

requirements: |
  In a solid app:
  The Start button should have the label "Generate & Copy Prompt"
  and should be a bit too large enough to be easily clicked.
  The tasklist should also be easier to find, and having a bg color.
  Also align the tasklist to the left, but use the given single-column layout.
  And add some space between the components.

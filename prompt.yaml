  We need a readme for the vscode extension, which is part of the Junior
  project. Write it to be catchy and to include relevant info about the project
  (based on the project readme).

  Mention that the extension and its doc was fully generated by ChatGPT!

  Features: 
    - The "Write Attention" junior.writeAttention command overwrites the attention descriptor based on the currently opened windows in vscode.
    - configuration is possible (extract relevant info from the code)
format: prompt/format/shell.md

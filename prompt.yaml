  Remove everything from the doc directory, we restart our documentation
  This is a monorepo, everything we ever write as documentation of this project, will go here
  So we need a hierarchy of directories. Create it!

  We want to write the docs in markdown, and generate html now and later other formats.

  We will use some documentation tools, so we need to select and install them.

  It would be great to host it on github pages, so we need to configure it.

  [vite:css] Nested CSS was detected, but CSS nesting has not been configured
  correctly. Please enable a CSS nesting plugin *before* Tailwind in your
  configuration.

  We already have one, try the config in the tailwind docs:

  // postcss.config.js module.exports = {
    plugins: {
      'postcss-import': {},
      'tailwindcss/nesting': {},
      tailwindcss: {},
      autoprefixer: {},
    }
  }

  No need to install anything.

  Also rename our config file to .cjs before applying the change so we can avoid
  import issues.

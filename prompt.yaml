  Add the following new info to the readme:
    - This readme was _fully_ generated with AI (note at the beginning).
    - I, the programmer of this project started to communicate only in english. I only read the code, never write it.
    - npm start starts a local server on port 3000, where you can generate a prompt and auto-copy it to paste to chatgpt.
    - The cli uses the chatgpt api, so need an api key in OPENAI_API_KEY env var
    - You need gpt-4 to get meaningful results.
    - licence: gpl-3.0
  
  Be concise!

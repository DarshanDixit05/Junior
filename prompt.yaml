  We need margins on large screens and a responsive layout.

  When looking at the page, after loading (empty prompt, prompt descriptor
  loaded), the prompt descriptor (A yaml file) should be the first element
  catching our eyes.

  Under that the notes input, and the start button so that it is easy to click
  after entering the notes.

  Over the prompt descriptor is the task list (a html select).

  When we click the button, the prompt is generated and displayed. It's a
  markdown. Display at the bottom.

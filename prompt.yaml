task: prompt/task/feature/implement.md
attention:
  - README.md
requirements: >
  1. Readme.md contains a broken link, "check out the prompt/task/implement.md file as an example." (refers https://github.com/tisztamo/Junior/blob/main/prompt/task/implement.md) The correct path is prompt/task/feature/implement.md
  2. Reword "Please remember that this project is designed to write itself." to say that we eat our own dog food.
format: prompt/format/shell.md

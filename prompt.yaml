  Add the following new info to the readme:
  There is a cli and a web interface.
  How to install
  How to run: "npm start" starts a local server on port 3000, where you can generate a prompt and auto-copy it to paste to chatgpt.
  How to use. What are tasks like "feature/implement" and "bug/fix", "refactor/".
  The cli uses the chatgpt api, so need an api key in OPENAI_API_KEY env var
  You need gpt-4 or a better model to get meaningful results (A note at the end).
